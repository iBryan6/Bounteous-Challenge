# Profile Component Coding Test

Please code the attached design. Feel free to use any tools you feel necessary. Please zip up all working files work and send it back to us. Let us know if you have questions or need clarification.

This test should not take you longer than 4 hours to complete.

## Requirements

- The component should look good on mobile, tablet, and desktop (responsive design).
- Code produced should be semantic and component should be built with accessibility in mind.
- Code the component as if it could be used multiple times on a single page (reusability, portability).
- Write your CSS in a way that would allow the component to scale if text were to change. For example the text could change and the white area would need to grow or shrink.
- On click of the 'follow' button, add a class to the component that changes something, your choice. If necessary, you can use jQuery, but we prefer vanilla JS.
- Please include a screenshot of your component in browser and a readme.md file to explain your work.

## What We're Looking For

- High quality front end code. Simple, well written, organized, and clean code.
- Strong attention to visual detail. First thing we review is how the component looks in the browser. (Hints: background color around the component, rounded corner radius, etc.).
- We're looking for a strong understanding of modern web standards.
- Please avoid Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks. We want to see your CSS/SCSS/LESS skills.
- Include build files (SASS/SCSS/LESS etc.).

### Bonus Points

- If this challenge seems simple and you complete quickly, feel free to add extras to _show off_ something you're excited about.

### Images

If you do not have Photoshop or are unable to extract the cover photo and profile image, feel free to use your own graphics. Alternatively can also easily grab images from [lorempixel.com](http://lorempixel.com/) or [placehold.it](http://placehold.it/).
