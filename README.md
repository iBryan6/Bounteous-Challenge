# Profile Component Coding Test

So, this was a very basic test since I didn't really use a lot of ReactJS for this one. Wasn't really sure if I had to retrieve this data from an API or just have it static.

- I made the tech hyperlinks text "dynamic", where I mapped an array that would act like it came from an API and added the `commas` to all hyperlinks texts expect the last one, where this element would recieve `and` before.
- I used installed and used SASS.
- When you click the Follow btn it changed it's styles and text to Following.
- I only used functional components for this one.

### Result

### Bonus Points

- Didn't have a lot of time this and last week to make something. I would have added unit tests, skeleton loading, maybe even carried this over to React Native.
